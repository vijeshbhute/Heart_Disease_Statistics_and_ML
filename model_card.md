# Model Card: Heart Disease prediction

See the [example Google model cards](https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/model-reports) for inspiration. 

## Model Description
The presence or absence of heart disease is predicted using a Losgitic regression model containing five input features. The model parameters (coefficients) and formulae is given below:

The probability of presence of heart disease is given by solving the following equation:  
<br>
$\ln \Big(\frac{p}{1-p}\Big) = b_0 + b_1*scaled\_gender + b_2*scaled\_chestpain + b_3*scaled\_restingrelectro + b_4*scaled\_oldpeak + b_5*scaled\_slope$

$ p = \frac{1}{1+exp(b_0 + b_1*scaled\_gender + b_2*scaled\_chestpain + b_3*scaled\_restingrelectro + b_4*scaled\_oldpeak + b_5*scaled\_slope)}$

where, $b_0 = 3.1856708$, $b_1 = 0.67344694, b_2=1.10716387,b_3=0.84976867,b_4=-1.28893841,b_5= 3.84886661$ <br><br>
<b>*Please note that the features should be scaled prior to prediction using the same scaling factor which was derived from the training set.</b><br><br>
If $p>0.51$ then the individual is likely to have heart disease.
